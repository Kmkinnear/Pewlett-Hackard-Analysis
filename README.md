# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to expand on our "Retiring Employees" analysis that we did for Pewlett Hackard. We were asked to first come up with the number of retiring employees and associate their job title with them. Then we did additional analysis to group the retiring employees together by their department/job-title. That way we could see which departments were going to be affected the most. Lastly, we did one more round of analysis to come up with a mentorship-eligiblity table that listed all employees who were coming close to retirement. 

## Results: 

The first table that we will look at is the "Retiring Employees" table

 - We see that the majority of the employees that are coming up for retirement are senior-level employees. This makes sense given the level of experience that they have attained over the years. Senior Engineers and Senior Staff members make up around 70% of the total employees that are retiring. That should be good news for any current Engineers or Staff members that are hoping to promote to senior-level employees.
 - One interesting takeaway that we have from looking at this chart is that only two employees with the title of "Manager" are showing. It's possible that we have some employees that are retiring who are managers, but are listed under a different job title. It could also mean that Pewlett-Hackard has managers in place across the company that are not at the age of retirement yet. 


## Summary
--Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."


### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?



### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
